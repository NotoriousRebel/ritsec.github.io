  </p>
  <p>
  We believe security is for anyone who wants to learn and center our activities around multiple aspects of security. This includes
  live individual and team-based competitions, hands-on training, student run research, and sponsor talks. Our security exercises
  cover a wide variety of areas in computing security, including penetration testing, Windows and Linux server hardening,
  web security, network services, and more!</p>
  <p>In 2018, the Security Practices And Research Student Association (SPARSA) and RIT Competitive Cybersecurity Club (RC3) merged to become RITSEC.
  As a result, the security community at RIT became more unified as the major and industry grew.</p>

    The Information Security Talent Search is an annual three-day cyber
    attack/defend competition typically hosted in the early spring at RIT.
    Every year, competitors from both RIT and invited colleges from around the
    country are faced with a wide variety of challenges which are designed to
    cover as many facets of the security industry as possible. This includes
    defensive and offensive capabilities, system administration, software
    security, networking, programming, and much more! Challenges and activities
    include a CTF, King-of-the-Hill, policy writing, incident response, and
    code review -- all while defending a completely student-built
    infrastructure!
